# PHP Flash Cards 
 This is basically a project that makes a comma-separated list using get_defined_function() and then scraping the php.net manual website to get the relevant information about it. \n After it's created the comma-separated list, it's ready to be made into Anki flash cards.

I'd like to make the format better inside the cards so if you have any suggestions, please let me know. I spent a lot of time trying to make it better but had to settle for the current mediocrity.

I've already added another script for generating flash cards for the HTTP Status Codes and I'm going to create scripts for other parts of PHP as well. (constants, classes, etc.)
